		<p>Yesterday, world famous explorer Jack Black has finally discovered what he calls the "Octagon". Jack had been searching for this elusive shape since he was only 20 years old.</p>
		<p>Why did he do it? He said, "For generations, my family has been in search for the "Octagon". None of my ancestors were successful, however, I am the first in the family to actually find the shape." It's likely Jack will soon win a Nobel Prize for this discovery.</p>
